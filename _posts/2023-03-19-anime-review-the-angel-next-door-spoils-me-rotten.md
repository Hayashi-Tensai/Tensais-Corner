Konbanwa! This time I’m back with a really good romance anime I watched recently called The Angel Next Door Spoils Me Rotten (Romanji: Otonari no Tenshi-sama ni Itsunomanika Dame Ningen ni Sareteita Ken). It’s a Winter 2023 anime and still airing at the time of writing. There is quite number of good animes this season and this one really takes the cake.

Before I start, I have to warn you, this anime is a diabetes overload. The interactions between main characters Mahiru and Amane is just too cute. So the story starts of with Mahiru being the perfect “Angel” in the class, and Amane is a bit of a less approachable one. One rainy day, there is a fateful encounter between two, starting of with Amane doing doing her a favour. But it was after this first encounter, Mahiru gets to know of Anane’s untidy and unhealthy lifesytle, she then go worried and started helping him cook and clean.

Over the course of the story, the anime explored the aspects of both their characters in the story, and as it goes along and just gets even sweeter.

Mahiru is a really reserved girl with quite a sad background of abandonment. This makes her strive to be best version of herself. But the more she interacts with Amane, she starts to open up, and start to learn what it means to have friends and that she can be true to herself.

As for Amane, he is someone who lacks self-confidence and doesn’t really stand out in class. And it is through his interactions with Mahiru that he learns to be more confident of himself and starts setting goals in his life.

There are a lot of sweet interactions between the two in this anime, and it really shows how the small things in life matters. Mahiru really spoils Amane a lot during the course of the story, and at the same time Amane helps Mahiru open up her feeling although Amane himself doesn’t realize it.

Overall, I really like anime, not only that it gives an overdose amount of sweetness, It’s a story of two people helping each other fight their own weaknesses that really makes the story stand out in terms of story development. Also, there seems to be a lot of romance anime coming out next season, I’ll write on them if I feel like it.
