This is the first ever video game I made ever since I started my degree.  
Let me explain a bit about this game.  
 
As this was my first game it had a very simple menu design

This game featured 4 maps.
 
Classic: 
This map is similar to the 8-bit version of Pong

Space:  
This map features an addition of portals, that teleports the ball randomly when the ball enters the portal

Snow:  
This map features two automatic snow paddles and snow walls at the top and bottom

Bounce:  
Last but not least, a map with a lot of annoying bouncy balls

To make the game more interesting there are 3 power ups that appear in the game:  
1. World Change
2. Double Ball
3. Directional Change
 
Overall, it was challenge to make this game as it was the first time making a game, not that good on design wise but the game play is not bad and quite fun.
