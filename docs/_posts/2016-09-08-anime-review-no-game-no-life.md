Konnichiwa minna! Today i would like to share another good anime i have watched :D 
This is an anime back in 2014 which i watch lately last month. I really liked the how the story is written and the art is also not bad.

Story - 9/10

First let me briefly give a short summary of how the story goes. it starts of with 2 NEET siblings, Sora and Shiro in Tokyo and there were being summoned into a fantasy world by a some boy named Tet. What is interesting about this fantasy world is that everything is decided entirely by games.

These two siblings then uses their intelligence and strategy in games to survive and exploit this fantasy world. Day by day they create new goals to achieve and finally to ultimate goal of challenging Tet. Through this journey, they eventually find out more about this fantasy world and create new allies along the way.

Music  8/10

Opening Song
**[Embed Video pending]**
The Opening has really motivating and fast tone and some hint of mystery, which somehow describes the feel of the anime. The lyrics is also quite meaningful as it tells the story of the two siblings, Sora and Shiro

Ending Song

The song has really soft and relaxing tone to it, but when combined with lyrics it gives a feel of a bittersweet childhood.

OSTs
The soundtracks of the anime i would say it is quite fitting with most of the scenes. Sometimes it gives a relaxing game feel, and at more important moments, it has a sort of mysterious feel and also sometimes motivating.

Art - 8/10
Art wise i would also it is quite good. It uses a very colourful amount of colours especially colours used in fantasy games.

Landscape Design
The town has a really interesting design of having that vibe of an old town, the brick and stone design but yet quite colourful. It has also feel of peaceful small town.

Character Design

Overall i would say the characters are quite detailed compared to other anime(s) out there, but still i would not comment much on this because my art suck to be honest.
