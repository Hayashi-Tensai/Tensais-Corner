    <p>Warning! Minor Spoilers</p>

<p>This review is made based on Episode 1-15</p>

<p>こんにちは、皆さん！Konnichiwa minna-san!</p>

<p>So as for today i am going to write a review on this anime most commonly known as Re: Zero.</p>

<p><img src="https://tensaiscorner.com/assets/blog-images/anime/re_zero.jpg" alt="Re-Zero_Poster" /></p>

<p>A friend of mine asked me to give a review on this anime, so i decided to make this my first blog post.</p>

<p>So First, my first impressions, the main character, Subaru gets transported into a fantasy world…hmm…sound interesting…..</p>

<p>Another Konosuba story?</p>

<p>Well the story starts with him tryinig to find out who summon him into that world, which is also pretty normal for a person who is placed a new world.</p>

<p>But, he real thing actually starts from Episode 1B, where everything just goes wrong. As the one of the tags of this anime says, psychological horror, it really is. Subaru just gets killed several times by all sorts of torturing methods….wait, now you may be wondering now, died several times? Let me explain, Subaru has a Return by Death ability which enables to travel back into a certain timeline. It sounds like an anime with a MC with a powerful magic power….no, it’s not.</p>

<p>How he actually dies again and again in torturing methods, brings him into an unstable mental state and………….oh,but that’s not what the anime is all about. Through the timelines, he made many bonds with people that is important to him. Without a purpose in this world, Subaru chooses to protect the people that are dear to him and live happily ever after? Of course not. The writer makes Subaru face many challenges and trials while also being weak and incapable of doing anything useful in this world, which he fails to protect the one dear to him again and again and finally gets through after facing many trials and breakdowns, and the process repeats again on a new arc and timeline.</p>

<p>On character development, it actually shows how Subaru gains the trust with Rem(which initially did not trust him at all) to something more than just a friendship. On the other hand, it also shows how Subaru and Emilia fails to understand each other creating conflicts between them, and also showing how the bonds around him affects his actions in repeated timelines.</p>

<p>This anime actually tells us to appreciate the people that are dear to us and also explains the meaning of unconditional love (Later episodes). Overall this anime may hurt your brain by a little LOT, but the deep meaning of the story is worth to watch for.</p>
