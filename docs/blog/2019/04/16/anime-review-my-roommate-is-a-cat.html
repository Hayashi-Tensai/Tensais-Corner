<em>(Japanese Title: Doukyonin wa Hiza, Tokidoki, Atama no Ue)</em></p>

<p>Konnchiwa! It has been almost 2 years since I wrote an anime review. This is an anime that just came last season of Winter 2019. I have watched it till episode 7 on the time of writting and I find it very enjoyable. Without futher ado, let’s get into the review.</p>

<p><strong>Story</strong><br />
So this anime is about a introverted guy named Subaru and his cat, Haru. A cat. No, not a cat girl, no gimmicks or whatsoever. Just a cat. The story goes about how Subaru warms up with his new found cat, as he faces challenges along the way on how to raise a cat, which he has no idea of.</p>

<p>I would say Sabaru as a character can be quite interesting. Being introverted, he does not know how to interact with people and also animals of his surroudings, but as the series goes on, he genuinely tries his best not to screw up interactions with others, but sometimes he just tries to run away from the situation. Quite interesting to watch I would say.</p>

<p>Another interesting point of this show is that the second half of each episode features the events of the episode from the Haru’s perpective, which is pretty cute I would say. At times, she would try to help Subaru through his daily life and Subaru ends up misunderstanding her actions. It’s pretty entertaining to see what they have in each other’s minds and how they interpret one another being a human and a cat.</p>

<p>On side note, Haru, being a cat also hit the the the top number one spot on anitrendz.net top female characters charts, which is pretty impressive for a cat xD.<br />

<p>I would say the story is pretty wholesome overall, I’ll give it a 10/10 for storyline.</p>

<p><strong>Art and Animation</strong><br />
The art is quite simple but it also nice. The animation isn’t fantastic, though it is kept at its minimal, it does have enough movement to convey the message and it has good use of transition to make up for the lack of movement. I’ll give an 8/10 for art and animation.</p>

<p>Overall I would say it’s a pretty wholesome and relaxing anime. I do recommend it for those who find some good anime to watch after a long and tired day from school or work. Overall rating 9/10.</p>
