    <p>It has been truly a sad past day for the anime community. Yesterday (July 18, 2019), Kyoto Animation’s studio was lighted up on fire by a 41 year old man, which has so far killed 33 people and many injured. Even after waking up today, it still shocks me that someone would do something like that to the studio.</p>

<p>Over the years, they have made so many great series and movies. They have inspired the anime industry with new art styles, unique ways story telling, lovable character personalities. It has really impacted each and every one of us anime fans one way or another.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hayashi-Tensai/Tensais-Corner/master/assets/blog-images/anime/kyoani.jpg" alt="KyoAni-picture" /></p>

<p>We will never forget the works KyoAni has done that has changed the anime industry, It has been truly a wonderful journey. It will definitely never be the same again for survivors of the incident but I hope for best for their recovery and I offer my condolences to the family of those who have passed. Lastly, to the survivors of the incident, I hope you stay strong and one day continue to inspire people again.</p>

<p>P.S. If you wish the support KyoAni and help them recover you can buy their online wallpaper at their official store,
