Konnichiwa! Today I'm back with a new review of an anime I have recently watched. The is anime is really a masterpiece of a kind so do sit back and read through the review.

**Storyline 10/10**

The story progresses quite slowly in the beginning but picks up the pace after around episode 4 or 5. So do stick around till then if you want to know where is the story heading.

Overall, it has a good mix of romance and comedy, there is room for where you can laugh at funny moments while enjoying the momentum on how the romance flows for the characters.

As for the main romance for the story, of course the main character...pretty obvious isn't it? Haha. The relationship start off with a quite unique relationship where the girl (not gonna spoil) relies heavily on Kanda (the guy) to help her in her daily life. The story advances to the point where she gets more independent and starts to care for Kanda compared to how she previously was, where she does not really care about the people around her. It's interesting how they go through their ups and downs as they are very different from each other.

As for the other romances? Just gonna tell you this, it's between a programmer and an England girl, and an animator and a script writer.

Go watch it to find out xD

**Music 9/10**

Opening and Ending  
The opening and ending song really matches to the theme of the of the story and it is really meaningful to listen to. Here's my favorite one out of the 2OPs and 2EDs the anime has:

**Art and Animation 9/10**  
<div>{%- include slideShow.html images=page.slideShow -%}</div>

The art is not one of the best I have seen so far but it is simple yet nice. And most importantly the art style was consistent over the span of 24 episodes. 

The animation on the other hand, deserves a spotlight for the show. Almost every movement is well animated with careful detail, and no visible error or skip in animation was spotted throughout the whole series. 

Overall 11/10

Overall, I would say this once more that this anime is truly a masterpiece. Definitely worth watching over and over again.
