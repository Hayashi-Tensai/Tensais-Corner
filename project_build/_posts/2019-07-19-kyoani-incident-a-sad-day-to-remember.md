author: Hayashi Tensai
excerpt: It has been truly a sad past day for the anime community. Yesterday (July 18, 2019), Kyoto Animation's studio was lighted up on fire by a 41 year old man, which has so far killed 33 people and many injured. Even after waking up today, it still shocks me that someone would do something like that to the studio.

It has been truly a sad past day for the anime community. Yesterday (July 18, 2019), Kyoto Animation's studio was lighted up on fire by a 41 year old man, which has so far killed 33 people and many injured. Even after waking up today, it still shocks me that someone would do something like that to the studio. 

Over the years, they have made so many great series and movies. They have inspired the anime industry with new art styles, unique ways story telling, lovable character personalities. It has really impacted each and every one of us anime fans one way or another.
