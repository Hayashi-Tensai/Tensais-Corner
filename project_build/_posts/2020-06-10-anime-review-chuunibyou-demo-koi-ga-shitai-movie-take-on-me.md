(Warning! contains minor spoilers, certain parts of the review would refer to prior knowledge after the events of season 1)

Konbanwa, Today I will be reviewing one of KyoAni's masterpieces, Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! but i will be focusing the review more on the movie. 

Over the span of two seasons, I would say the development of the two main characters, Yuta and Rikka has really built the up to the moments of the movie. The chemistry of these two is rarely seen in any other romance anime, they have this unique relationship where it is very different from normal couples. The way the story approaches the concept of chuunibyou and romance together as one really melts your heart and it just makes you come back for more.

Leading into the events of the movie, there are just so many unexpected happenings in the movie, it just keeps you guessing on what is going to happen next. The whole journey they took, the decisions they made, the whole experience was just so mesmerizing to watch. Their journey has lead to some unexpected developments and it has really brought their relationship a step further that before.

The whole series in general, reminds the freedom of choices back in our youth, not bound by the expectations that is place by the ever judgemental society. And this movie shows us exactly that, two immature high schoolers going places in a flash of decisions, living the most out their youth. Adding chunnibyou into the mix, it just feels the world is so limitless for them, a world filled with imagination. It makes you wonder about the cruel reality we are in, and just how different things would be in this chunnibyou world filled with imagination.

Overall, the movie was one heck of a roller coaster ride of emotions, and it will definitely be one of those anime that will have that special place in my heart for the many years to come.
