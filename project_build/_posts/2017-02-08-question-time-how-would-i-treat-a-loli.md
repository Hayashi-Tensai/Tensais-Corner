Konnichiwa! It has been a while since i wrote a post and i thought this would be an interesting to talk about. And also do share your opinions in the comments below :)

I thought about this while i was thinking about the "lolicon community" and i thought that i share my opinion. Just that so we are on the same page, i am referring to lolis high school and below and does not include adult lolis.

I am sure many of you have heard about phrases like "Lolis are for patting not for fapping" and "Jail" , when it comes to something related to loli. The thing about how majority or at least a huge number of the "lolicon" community is that they tend to look at a loli sexually which i would highly disagree. If they were to have feelings, this would hurt the their feelings in exchange for your "needs". Is it worth hurting them? NO.

But anyways, enough of that, let's get back to question: How would I treat a loli? So as for me i would like to see them happy all the time and do want avoid them making them cry (and plus i do not know how to handle a crying kid, I'm bad at handling it). A loli's (or a child) feelings is very fragile and they are very easily hurt by something small, which relates to their innocent personality. Their innocent and mostly cheerful personality is what make special and heartwarming.

I would also want to spoil them and try to get whatever want, as long as it does not cost me a fortune. You may say getting them(loli/ child) spoiled is a bad idea, but let me put this into a real life scenario, the world out there is harsh to be honest and I feel that they should not feel that they are suffering when it comes to home.

So well that is my opinion, I placed some real life factors to it as i wanted it to have a feel of like them existing in real life with real feelings. That's all from me, what's your opinion?
