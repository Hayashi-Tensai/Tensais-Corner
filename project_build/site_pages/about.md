Hi, welcome to my website where I showcase my work and also write some other stuff. First, let me introduce myself, I go by many names and I'll list it down below:  
    - Thianchai Phromsuwan (Thai, given and officially registered name)  
    - 林天才 (Chinese and given name)  
    - Hayashi Tensai, also written as 林天才 (unofficial Japanese name)  

I studied game programming in KDU University College, Glenamarie, Malaysia. I am passionate about games and I hope to one day make a game that will touch the hearts of others. 
Under the bachelor's programmme, I have learnt different aspects of game development such as graphics programming, networking, and as well as team game projects from time to time. 
I have also picked up some skills on web development and databases from my current job.

Personally, I have loved anime ever since I was 12, and it has a part of my life for the longest I can remember. 
On the other hand, I also really admire the Japanese culture when it comes to their language, the manners they practice, 
work pride and efficiency and as well as the richness in their traditional culture. 

Hope to write more in the future! :D
