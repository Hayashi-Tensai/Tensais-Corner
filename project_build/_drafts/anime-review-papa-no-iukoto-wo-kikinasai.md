(Warning! Spoilers up to around Episode 2)

Konbanwa, today we will looking at anime that came out quite a while back in 2012 called Papa no Iukoto wo Kikinasai! or in short PapaKiki. So a short synopsis, Segawa Yuuta, a college freshman has been placed to care for three of his nieces, Hina, Miu and Sora while his sister,Yuri and her husband go off on a trip. But an incident strike upon Yuri and her husband, and the Yuuta decided to to take the three of them in to prevent the three of them from being split up.

I would say this anime is a really enjoyable one, On the surface, It make look like some kind of loli/high school harem, but it's actually not. Every episode has some depth and weight to every scene. Throughout the whole series it really shows how their relationship grows as a family. Yuuta goes through a lot challenges to the raise the three of them and comes to understand that raising them as thier guardian is not easy task. It is also not easy for Hina, Miu and Sora, and they are also trying to adjust to their new life living in together as a family in a one room apartment.

Life has never been dull moment for Yuuta caring for the three of them, as he to fulfill the needs of three girls with very unique personalities. First, we have Hina, 3 years old, has a very bubbly personality needs a more attention due to her young age. He tries to not bring up about her parents while in front her. The neighbors and shopkeepers love her and always give her the special treatment. Next, there is Miu, 10 years old, a very active and cheeful girl with a sense of fashion
