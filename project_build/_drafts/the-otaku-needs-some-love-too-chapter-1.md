The sound of keyboard of typing echoes the office as the whole team is rushing a deadline for some fancy business solutions program the bosses are so excited about... which frankly speaking there's nothing fancy about it, just a messy piece of code that is a sorry excuse for a program. I just got hired to this company not too long ago after the previous company I worked with ran out of business. I'm Amane Masami, a 25 years old average and boring programmer, and most importantly still single.

Looking at the time, it has been an hour past office hours, I decided I call it a day. I packed up all stuff and start heading back home. As per usual I head back home by foot as it is only 15 minutes walk from my workplace.

"Ah Kayo-chan, what is it?"
"Onii-chan!!! you are late for dinner, didn't you say you will come back earlier for dinner?"

That's my younger sister on line, Amane Kayo. She is in her second year of college right now studying culinary arts. Ah...seriously she makes the best cooking in world, I wouldn't ask a better sister than that,

"Sorry about that...I had some unfinished work to do. Have you eaten your dinner?"
"I have already eaten without you, I would have starved to death if I have waited for you! Hmph!"
"Hahaha....really sorry about that, I am on the way back now you can have my food warmed up soon"

Beep Beep Beep...

"Looks like she hang up on me again..."

I have been always late from work lately, so she has eating dinner alone lately most of time. I guess it can be quite lonely for her. Our parents are not home most of time as they always assign somewhere else for work. So it's really just me and and my sister at home mostly. 

After a bit of walking, I have finally arrived to a small apartment complex. I walked up to stairs to the second floor where I live. A three room apartment, just enough space to fit the whole family when father and mother is around that is. Else there will be just that one empty room that is unused collecting a lot dust as we speak.

"I'm home"
"Welome back...." greeted by sister in a rather sour voice, she then stares at the dinner table ready to strike at something. "Hehe, I will eating your tofu away as punishment for being late."
"Spare me, anything but my precious tofu"
"Just kidding....but I'll take your tofu for real next time if you are late again"

My sister teases me again, she knows tofu is favorite comfort food. Nothing beats that hot and fluffy tofu after a long day of work. As I am already starving, I headed straight to the dinner table to get myself that much needed dinner.

"If you are gonna eat before you have your bath, at least have a change a clothes"
"Hai..."

My sister bosses me around sometimes, well that is why I get for being a useless good for nothing big brother. I proceed to get a change of clothes and finally dig in for dinner after a long day of work.

"Itadakimasu!"
Nom Nom Nom

"Argh, your tofu are sure the best, just the right texture!" Right in front of me is a plate a tofu and fish along side with a bowl rice and miso soup with....you guess it, more tofu. Best dinner in the world! While I'm in the middle of enjoying my dinner, my sister suddenly asks me a question.

"Say.....Onii chan, when will you be getting a girlfriend?"
I spat out my soup in shock of that question.

"What is it asking this so sudden?"
"You are already 25, have not even been in a single relationship."
".....Aren't you also single?"
"Well... I had experience....back in high school...." She fidgets a little as she strunggles to say it. "At least I don't hang virtual pngs all over the room."

It feels like she just pierce an arrow right into my heart, the truth has never been more bitter. Even though I have my virtual waifus to keep me company, it lacks that physical touch of real person, you can't really talk to them, and they are well...virtual....but sometimes I do wonder if life is even real, or just another virtual lie?

"I'll think about it...."
My sister then pouts and heads off kitchen without saying a word. The rest of the meal was then mostly silent as I finish off my dinner.
