**Background Story**  
You, the knight's rational squire and the knight, had set out to find a legendary sword, which had also sprung a trap that lead to you being separated within the fortress’ dungeons.

Now, you will have to manipulate the connecting bridges that were a part of the fortress’ defense mechanisms, to deal with enemies, traps, and the reckless Knight to ensure that the both of you escape, grab the sword and return home.
